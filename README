This is a Seive of Eratosthenes implementation used to find prime numbers..
I have successfully generated a 17gb file of prime numbers using this which ends
in the prime 33906393741. This, not unexpectedly, took a long time due to the creation of such a large vector<bool> object, despite bit compression. 
This file compressed down to 4gb (taking some time to do so..) and so for future 
work I think I'll be working on making it a segmented seive, and outputting directly to a compressed format. 

Released under the GPL, requires CMAKE and BOOST (though very simple to remove that requirement - just comment out the boost header and change the typedef to a std type such as unsigned long long
